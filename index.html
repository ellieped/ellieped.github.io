    <h3>What is this all about</h3>
    <p>I decided to take up some front end development in my spare time.  The reason for creating this page is to help expend on what I 
      learned.  While I al learning I will be updating this page on the new items I have picked up.  Also I might start a small blog on 
      what I acomplished the prior day with links to the code that I did.
