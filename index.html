    <h3>What is this all about</h3>
    <p>I decided to take up some front end development in my spare time.  The reason for creating this page is to help expend on what I 
      learned.  While I al learning I will be updating this page on the new items I have picked up.  Also I might start a small blog on 
      what I acomplished the prior day with links to the code that I did.

  <h3>12-13-2018</h3>
  <p>Yesterday started off fun.  I first thought about making this page last night and did some quick google searching to look for ways to 
  start the page.  I was going to use a droplet in Digital Ocean, but when doing that I was using the wordpress app.  With doing this 
  I was having hard times locating where to insert my new knowledge at?  There was allot of places that are preconfigured for post and what
  not but no place I could locate right away to stick some peer html code.  After some time I found it and through the slack group at 
  code newby it sounds like this will be a constant thing.  Instead sticking with it I started this page of Github with the resportorys.  
  Just a little googleing and help through the forms at codenewby I had this up in no time.  Then I started to look into what I have been 
  learning.  With that I started module 3 on the html and css edx course.  This deals with css.  Mostly styling the page.  I read a couple
  of things basiclly in your html code you will have the p tags for paragraphs and in the css code you can style that with using  this
  p {
    font-size: 32px:
  }
  and what not.  However when learning that I wanted to see if I change the first paragraph I had in this page.  Ohh man this took me 
  forever.  First I was creating another section and not leaving in my mastfile for the program.  When I finally found out how to upload
  a folder to the respitory I was still having issues.  Since the css is located in a folder called CSS I was trying different paths
  as in CSS/style.css and /CSS/style.css back and forth and nothing worked.  finally I found the issue after like an hour or so.  It
  was a piece of code as in type="text/css".  I put this in the link element because I seen it on a page that someone was using for git
  hub and thought it was needed.  When I finally removed it everything started to work.
